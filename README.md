## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Python:** Version 3.6 or higher
- **Git:** (Optional) For cloning the repository

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Srihaas007/file-manager-pro.git
   ```

   Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd file-manager-pro
   ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

   - **Windows:**

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - **macOS/Linux:**

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure you have `pip` installed. Then, install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   **Dependencies:**

   - PyQt5
   - send2trash
   - Pillow
   - tqdm
   - cryptography
   - watchdog
   - plyer

6. **Configure the Application:**

   - **Populate `config.json`:**

     Ensure that the `config.json` file is populated with the necessary configurations. If it's empty, refer to the [Configuration](#configuration) section below.

   - **Generate Encryption Key:**

     If encryption functionalities are to be used, generate an encryption key:

     ```bash
     python utils/encryption_utils.py generate_key
     ```

     This will create a `secret.key` file in the project directory.

## Usage

### Launching the Application

After completing the installation and configuration steps, launch the application using the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will open the **File Manager Pro** GUI, where you can navigate through different tabs to access various functionalities.

### Configuration

The `config.json` file is central to configuring the application's behavior. Here's a sample configuration:

```json
{
    "file_categories": {
        "Images": [".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png", ".gif", ".bmp", ".tiff"],
        "Videos": [".mp4", ".avi", ".mkv", ".mov", ".wmv"],
        "Documents": [".doc", ".docx", ".pdf", ".txt", ".xls", ".xlsx", ".ppt", ".pptx"],
        "Audio": [".mp3", ".wav", ".aac", ".flac"],
        "Archives": [".zip", ".rar", ".7z", ".tar", ".gz"],
        "Others": []
    },
    "backup_directory": "Backup",
    "encryption_key_file": "secret.key",
    "email_notifications": {
        "enabled": false,
        "smtp_server": "",
        "smtp_port": 587,
        "sender_email": "",
        "sender_password": "",
        "receiver_email": ""
    }
}
```

**Configuration Options:**

- **`file_categories`:** Define file extensions for categorizing files.
- **`backup_directory`:** Specify the directory where backups will be stored.
- **`encryption_key_file`:** Path to the encryption key file.
- **`email_notifications`:** Configure email settings for notifications.

**Note:** Ensure that `config.json` contains valid JSON data. If it's empty, the application will attempt to recreate it with default settings upon launch.
